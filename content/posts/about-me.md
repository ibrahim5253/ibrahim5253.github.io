Hey, there! I'm Khadija - 20 something cute, little girl with bubbly, zealous personality. Among other things, I like to eat, sleep, and laugh - a lot! When I'm not doing any of those things, you can find me in my favorite corner under the sunny window in my cozy home memorizing the Holy Quran.

_PS: I've a fiance, and it's actually him who maintains this website. He's a nerdy, shy guy who spends most of his waking hours staring at screen(s). In case you haven't guessed it already, this horrible post was written by him. Sigh._
